The short, rather plump wife of a
starved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant
had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.
The Vengeance.
The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of
a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.
The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about
her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to
house, rousing the women.
The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,
and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance
from him in the Hall.
Defarge
had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable
wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned
her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance
and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows
had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high
perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, "Bring him
out!
Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept:  even The Vengeance slept with
her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest.
The
Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
was seized;
The Vengeance.
The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than
a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and,
danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The
Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, "Well, I am sure, Boldface!
Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
turning to her friend The Vengeance:

"The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as
little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly
considered?
We have seen nothing else," returned The Vengeance.
The Vengeance followed.
A moment
afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by
the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in
hand with The Vengeance.
It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the
audience, thus assisted the proceedings.
The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked,
"I defy that bell!
Madame Defarge,
smiling to The Vengeance.
The Vengeance assisted
in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment.
The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, "Yes,
my faith!
The Vengeance, also, highly
approved.
The Vengeance, and embraced her.
XIV

The Knitting Done


In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate
Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and
Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury.
There is no better," the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill
notes, "in France.
Peace, little Vengeance," said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, "hear me speak.
The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses.
Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer
to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:

"She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death.
The Vengeance;
I willingly obey the orders of my Chief," said The Vengeance with
alacrity, and kissing her cheek.
Be sure you are there, my soul,"
said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned
into the street, "before the tumbrils arrive!
The Vengeance and the
Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative
of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.
On one
of the fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her
friend.
The Vengeance, petulantly.
Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear
thee.
Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet
it will hardly bring her.
The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair,
"and here are the tumbrils!
As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads.
If he
had given any utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would
have been these:

"I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the
Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the
destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument,
before it shall cease out of its present use.

The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the
ruins of feudal society has not done away with clash
antagonisms.
Modern bourgeois society with its relations of
production, of exchange and of property, a society that
has conjured up such gigantic means of production and
of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer
able to control the powers of the nether world whom he
has called up by his spells.
It is enough to
mention the commercial crises that by their periodical
return put on its trial, each time more threateningly,
the existence of the entire bourgeois society.
The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to
comprise the wealth created by them.
In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to
increase accumulated labour.
In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the
present;
In bourgeois society capital is independent
and has individuality, while the living person is
dependent and has no individuality.
According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to
have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness;
In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes
and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in
which the free development of each is the condition for
the free development of all.
Feudal Socialism


Owing to their historical position, it became the
vocation of the aristocracies of France and England to
write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society.
Petty-Bourgeois Socialism

The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that has
ruined by the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose
conditions of existence pined and perished in the
atmosphere of modern bourgeois society.
In countries where modern civilisation has become fully
developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been
formed, fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie
and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of
bourgeois society.
German Socialism forgot,
in the nick of time, that the French criticism, whose
silly echo it was, presupposed the existence of modern
bourgeois society, with its corresponding economic
conditions of existence, and the political constitution
adapted thereto, the very things whose attainment was
the object of the pending struggle in Germany.
CONSERVATIVE, OR BOURGEOIS, SOCIALISM

A part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing
social grievances, in order to secure the continued
existence of bourgeois society.

Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and

Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and

His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back

`I have known him walk with--I have known him walk
with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.
It really seemed as if he had known our
Tiny Tim, and felt with us.
But however
and when ever we part from one another, I am sure we
shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this
first parting that there was among us.
Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from
God.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.
And so, as Tiny Tim
observed, God bless Us, Every One!

Still he must have had fire and
mettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder.
The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and
heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward,
snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a
suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head.
Once more he cudgelled the sides
of the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with
involuntary fervor into a psalm tune.
He made no offer of molestation or sociability,
but kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side
of old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.
Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and
old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge;
It encountered his cranium
with a tremendous crash,--he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and
Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a
whirlwind.
